Bootstrap example
=================

This is an example that documents Bootstrap. It has a few files in here:

    index.html       - this is the styleguides generated from the
                       CSS files.

    buttons.css      - these are CSS files with inline comments that
    forms.css          Styledown parses.
    components.css
    lists.css
    panels.css
    ...
   
    _extras.css      - contains the Styledown config, and a few overrides
                       for the default Styledown styles.
   
    Makefile         - a small script that invokes Styledown to
                       generate index.html.
   
To build this project, use `make`.
